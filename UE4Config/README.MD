This is a modified copy of the UE4 Built.bat file- it does a couple things:
- Plays the build start/succeed/fail audio cues I've gotten so accustomed to with UE4 in VSCode
- Colors the screen a bit so that it's easier to tell where the errors are in the TERMINAL tab in VSCode.

This only works in Windows and requires the followings steps:
1. You'll need to download and install [nircmd](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html)
2. You'll need to replace the wav files I used with wav files of your own choosing.

If you want my exact same setup, all I did was convert the UE4 audio cues to .wav files and saved them in the same directory with the same name. I used Audacity to record the audio output of my audio drivers and save them as wav files.
